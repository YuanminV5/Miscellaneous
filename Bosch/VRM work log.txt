1. Multiple call to get auth info, each call will create a authinfo object.
2. when log off, get auth info is called.
3. when log off, auth info is not destroyed.
4. call sequence of usermanagement destroy and delete authInfo. DANGER.
5. check for token empty.
6. for empty password, can remain empty or not? now it is a placeholder text "_not_set_" 
7. for four eye login, username has + while password doesn't have. How? 
8. Permission check: currently only check for PlayBackVideo 
9. Bosch Video Client could not log in: password string received in VRM is encrypted. 
--> should not be forwarded to plugin if http


checkpermission:
getTrackListRCP invoke check for PlayBackVideo, line 93
